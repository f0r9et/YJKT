## Data Compilation

The process of gathering and organizing this data was not something I could accomplish on my own. Although the URLs were encrypted using MD5, I couldn't decrypt them myself. I spent a night running computations on my i5 5200U laptop, iterating from 32 zeros (0) to 32 F's (F), but even after 50,000 attempts, no results emerged. Eventually, I sought help from someone with database expertise, but I(we?) couldn't retrieve all the necessary data.

## Personal Experience

During a technical skills competition, I participated in a two-person robot contest. However, after the problem statement was released, I found myself under immense pressure. The pressure stemmed from various sources, such as the stress of the competition itself, managing progress compared to other teams, meeting the teacher's expectations, coordinating schedules with seniors, receiving criticism from family members, and discussing with classmates.

Originally, I had informed the teacher that I intended to focus on software development and programming. But during the competition, I ended up working on hardware instead. My partner, who claimed that I had low resistance to pressure, used this as an opportunity to berate and push me. I was told that I had to be proficient in both software and hardware, as failure to do so would hinder the project's progress. However, my partner even mistook our team's sensors for another group's, causing me to waste an entire day troubleshooting until I discovered the actual issue. When I mentioned that I was still providing power to the circuit while testing, my partner simply told me to shut up. Later, when the teacher arrived, my partner shifted all the blame onto me, claiming to have only burnt out one motor. I had even created a competition progress GIF, showcasing our assigned tasks and responsibilities.

After the first day of the competition, I found myself hiding under a blanket, crying. And after the competition ended, I sat alone on the bus, crying. I couldn't comprehend why all of this was happening. It was during this time that I became engrossed in the game I mentioned earlier, which coincidentally started right after the competition. I created six accounts and single-handedly managed guild battles on the least populated server in the Taiwanese version. Through this game, I joined a Discord group and shared my feelings of failure, but they showed understanding and support. Despite my nonsensical ramblings, I continued to be part of the

 group. My father frequently picked fights with me, so I would also vent my frustrations to them. However, as time went by, I gradually stopped reaching out to them.

Recently, I thought that since I had free time and access to better computers in a certain lab during my vacation, I should engage in a serious project. However, after sharing it with others using a different account, I noticed that I unintentionally used the words "harassment" and "victims" while documenting my progress. The group's announcement explicitly addressed this issue, so I would like to express my apologies to the members of the group.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the community and individuals who have been supportive during my challenging times. I apologize for any inconvenience or discomfort caused by my words or actions.
