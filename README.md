## Introduction

This repository contains a web application that was developed during a period of leisure and experimentation. The project aims to showcase the author's programming skills, despite their self-perceived lack of intelligence, expertise, and knowledge.

## Disclaimer

The author would like to emphasize that they do not possess any intellectual property rights, skills, or valuable knowledge. They acknowledge their lack of authority and power to claim ownership or assert any legal rights. If there are copyright concerns or other related issues, the author suggests requesting the removal of their account directly from GitHub.

The author humbly acknowledges their self-perceived limitations in thinking and communication abilities. They recognize that their thoughts and expressions may not align with conventional norms.

## Project Details

The inspiration for this web application came from an intense three-day battle with an AI named "Bing" during a prolonged vacation. The content and visuals used in the project were sourced from the game database of "Mahoroba Youjokitan" (妖女奇譚), available at the following link: `cdn-static-jprd-sakura.fusion-studio.co.jp`. However, due to the game's discontinued service, the author cannot guarantee the accuracy of the related information.

Please note that the web application does not include any explicit or adult content. The author took measures to ensure the removal of any potentially inappropriate CG (computer graphics) during the development process.

## Acknowledgements

The author would like to acknowledge that they did not possess the knowledge to retrieve the data independently. The author attempted to decrypt the URLs using MD5 encryption, utilizing their i5 5200U laptop for overnight calculations. Despite their efforts, they were unable to obtain any meaningful results. Seeking assistance from individuals experienced in database management, the author's data collection efforts remained incomplete.

## Personal Experiences

The author participated in a technical competition involving a two-person robot challenge. However, from the moment the competition topics were announced, the author faced numerous pressures. These pressures included the stress of the competition, the progress expectations from different teams, the demands of the teacher, the scheduling arrangements made by seniors, the criticisms from family members, and the discussions among classmates.

Initially, the author had expressed their intention to focus on software and programming aspects to their teacher. However, during the competition, the author found themselves working on hardware-related tasks. Meanwhile, the other team member, who considered the author to have low stress tolerance, used this as an opportunity to belittle and pressure them. The author was forced to handle all aspects, as the teacher had suggested that software skills should include hardware integration. Despite their efforts, even tasks as simple as changing a sensor resulted in the wrong sensor being installed, causing a day-long search for the issue. When the author mentioned that the circuit was still powered and cautioned against manipulating the motors, they were met with dismissive responses. Subsequently, after the teacher's arrival, all responsibility was shifted to the author, who had even created a competition progress GIF to aid in the division of tasks.

At the end of the first day of the competition, the author found solace in tears, hiding beneath a blanket. Following the conclusion of the competition, the author silently wept while sitting alone on the bus. The author remains uncertain about the reasons behind these experiences. However, the game they developed is a product of their addiction during the period following the competition. They managed six accounts and participated in guild

 battles alone, despite playing on the least populated server in the Taiwanese region. By chance, the author joined a Discord group during this time and shared their frustrations with the competition. The group members exhibited understanding and acceptance, even in the face of the author's incoherent ramblings. Despite being unable to articulate meaningful thoughts, the author continued to be a part of the group. The author's father frequently engaged in arguments, which led the author to seek solace by sharing their grievances. Still, someone always listened. It was only after the author casually enrolled in a national university that they managed to break free from the scenario of being financially dependent on their father. Consequently, they gained more time and embarked on a spree of thoughtless activities. However, one day, the group suddenly announced a measure to curb irrational discussions, prompting the author to withdraw from the group.

## Conclusion

The author recently contemplated using their upgraded computer specifications, acquired while working in a certain laboratory during their vacation, to dedicate themselves seriously to a project. Unfortunately, upon reviewing the document they had written, the author noticed the mention of the words "harassment" and "victims" within the chat group context. The author acknowledges the presence of these sensitive terms and apologizes for any discomfort caused. It is important to note that these words were used in a self-deprecating manner and should not be construed as an endorsement or approval of any form of harassment.
